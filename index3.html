				Based on the analysis undertaken by the team on the date from Burning Glass associated with the skills and roles in demand within the IT industry, it didn’t necessarily change the ideal jobs that we had selected in assignment one. 
				This activity did the provide the team the opportunity to reflect on the board range of skills and experience that are required within the information technology industry and just how niche the roles we had selected where in the market. <br>
				The exercise did make us aware of the other skills and experience that we would need to develop and accrue to build a more transferrable skillset within the industry. This particularly stood out with some of the general and soft skills that were highlighted in the report. <br>
				As there are only 2 people in the team, opinions may have differed if there had been a greater variety of roles and skills to review.
