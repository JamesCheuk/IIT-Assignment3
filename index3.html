			<h1>Aims</h1>
			<p>The ultimate aim of this project is to produce a reliable and user-friendly location triggered alarm that users can rely on when they get distracted on their travels to alert them of their destination arriving. For our application to be usable, it must first have its location triggered alarm function along with a friendly, intuitive user interface. To achieve these, we will need a program that can access and control the ringing, vibration and location tracking functions of the device and an attractive, simple user interface to make it easy for the user to use it.</p>
			<p>Once the application reaches the market, as we gather more feedback and reach more milestones in downloads, we will add extra features such as saving a list of alarms for use, customisation of each alarm and maps available for download for offline use.</p>
