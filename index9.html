			<table>
				<tr>
					<th>ID</th>
					<th>Title</th>
					<th>Risks</th>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>1</td>
					<td>Resource Skills</td>
					<td>
						<p>As the resources assigned to the project are new to app development, there is a risk that the activities associated with the development of the HTML and Code for Wake App will take longer than anticipated. </p>
						<p>As a result, the planned development takes longer than anticipated. </p>
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>2</td>
					<td>Resource Availability</td>
					<td>
						<p>As the resources assigned to work on the project are not available full time and are working on other projects, there is a risk they may not be able to work the forecasted hours each week required on the project. </p>
						<p>As a result, delays are experienced with starting and finishing forecasted activities on time. </p>
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>3</td>
					<td>Defect Management and Rework</td>
					<td>
						<p>As the assigned resources are new to app development, there may be a higher volume of defects identified throughout the unit, system, and user acceptance testing. </p>
						<p>As a result, additional time may be required for testing to ensure that a fully functional application is ready to launch. This will impact the project's ability to launch on time. </p>
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>4</td>
					<td>User Feedback obtained through usability testing</td>
					<td>
						<p>As a result of the feedback obtained from usability testing, there is a risk that proposed wireframes will need to be significantly updated to meet the primary needs of the users. </p>
						<p>As a result, the development of the App will be delayed. </p>
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>5</td>
					<td>Market Competitors</td>
					<td>
						<p>There is a risk that a competitor may launch a similar app before the launch of Wake App and trademark it. </p>
						<p>As a result, the project may no longer be viable. </p>
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>6</td>
					<td>App Store Standards / Launch Readiness</td>
					<td>
						<p>There is a risk that once completed, Wake App does not meet the required standards to be launched via Apple or Google's App stores. </p>
						<p>As a result, changes may need to be made to Wake App post-development completion to ensure the design and legal standards to be launch via both delivery channels. </p>
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>7</td>
					<td>Compatibility Standards</td>
					<td>
						<p>There is a risk that before launch, both Apple and Google introduce new standards that new apps are required to meet before being launched. </p>
						<p>As a result, the design and development of Wake App needs to be changed. This would create rework and delay the launch of the App. </p>
