			<h1>Group Reflection</h1>
				<p>Tackling a four (4) person assignment with only two (2) people has certainly been challenging, due to the workload for each of us essentially doubling. 
				While challenging, it has also been rewarding knowing that we are capable of handling it this well. Below are our thoughts.</p>
				<h2>What went well</h2>
					<p><b>Teamwork</b></p>
					<p>Despite there being two (2) team members in this group, we effectively delivered each assessment component and evenly shared the workload. </p>
					<p><b>Regular, scheduled meetings</b></p>
					<p>The regularly scheduled meetings (Sunday 2pm and Thursday 8pm) meant there was regular contact between the two (2) members to talk about problems and next steps to take.</p>
				<h2>What could be improved?</h2>
					<p><b>Team Members</b></p>
					<p>To effectively undertake a project of this size and deliver a viable product to the market, the right skills and experience are required. Additional team members may have changed the dynamic of the group and brought in different thinking. </p>
					<p><b>GitHub</b></p>
					<p>While the use of GitHub has improved from the previous assignment, it probably could have been used a little more frequently.</p>
				<h2>At least one thing that was surprising</h2>
					<p><b>Forecasting and Planning</b></p>
					<p>Despite the team's best-laid plans, the time taken to deliver each component of the project tended to take longer than anticipated. It may be due to each member being new to designing and developing a mobile device App. </p>
					<p><b>Development Timeline</b></p>
					<p>While the group generally knew it takes a long time to develop any application, it was still a surprise to some members when they personally experienced how time consuming the preparation is, even before talk of coding began.</p>
				<h2>At least one thing you learned about groups</h2>
					<p><b>Communications</b></p>
					<p>Communication played a critical role in being able to work through each component of the project effectively. It provided the team with a clear understanding of how well the work was progressing, the issues impacting progress, and whether the plan needed to be updated or changed.</p>
					<p><b>Team Processes and Communications</b></p>
					<p>Establishing the team processes and communication channels provided the team with an excellent operating rhythm and discipline to progressively work through the assessment. Once established, it improved the effectiveness of how the team worked together. </p>
