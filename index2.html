			<h1>Overview</h1>
			<h2>Topic</h2>
			<p>Our project is a Location Triggered Alarm, which works by setting off an alarm once the user is within a certain distance from their choosing destination. We plan to develop the application for use mainly on mobile devices and have it available for download on the Google PlayStore and the Apple iOS store. We hope that this application can be useful for everyone, especially those who rely on public transportation. It will allow the users to disengage from the outside world for a while and focus on themselves, whether it is a quick nap or to catch up on a Netflix series.</p>
			<p>We aim for the application to be successful that it becomes a standard feature in future mobile devices, similar to how years in the past users needed to download a separate application just to use the light on their phone as a flashlight and now it is a standard feature.</p>
			<h2>Motivation</h2>
			<p>This project is interesting for us because we have an opportunity to create an application to handle a particular issue that everyone would have experienced at least once in their lives, which is missing their stop as they overslept or were too preoccupied with something. We feel that this application would be a very welcome addition to everyone’s devices. Hopefully, through its success, it becomes a standard feature on future phones, similar to how older smartphones did not come with their flashlight capability and users needed to install an extra application.</p>
			<p>Through developing this application, we hope to show future employers that we can conceive practical IT solutions to everyday problems that are easy to make and maintain. We hope that the following skills we develop in the IT industry will prove useful for future employers, which is:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Programming – being comfortable using Object Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in a language built to use this principle, Java, such that learning other programming languages that use OOP as required for different jobs becomes easier. </li>
				<li>UX Design – the knowledge and skills used to build the user-friendly, modern and clean looking UX for our application can be advantageous we designing UX for other projects</li>
				<li>Product Management – as we manage the product during its development and after its release, it will give us knowledge of what users want, what the market needs as we look to develop more projects. We will also develop and polish our customer service skills.</li>
			</ul>			
			<h2>Landscape</h2>
			<p>Currently, on the Google Play store (image taken on 15/11/2020, 11:35 am), there is quite a selection of applications that provide the same base function as our project plan. There are two applications with 50k+ downloads (Naplarm and Alarm-Me), with several others at 10k+, suggesting demand for this product. Upon reading the user reviews for these competitors, we have identified several ways our application would differ and hopefully give us a competitive edge. The differences are:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Lack of an option for offline use by downloading maps for use in the device’s internal storage</li>
				<li>Overabundance of advertisements</li>
				<li>Some applications’ contact developer is bogus; thus, users are unable to provide feedback unless it was an app store review</li>
				<li>Some applications seemed unsupported as time went on, resulting in incompatibility issues with newer OS versions and other bugs appearing</li>
			</ul>
			<p>By ensuring that our product does not include any of the above issues, we are confident that our application will capture the majority of the market with ease.</p>
