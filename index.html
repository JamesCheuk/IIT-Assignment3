			<h2>Group Processes & Communications</h2>
			<p>
				To work through the different components of the assessment, the following group processes have been implemented. 
			</p>
			<h3>Regular Team Meeting</h3>
			<p>
				A bi-weekly team meeting has been established; 2 pm each Sunday and 8 pm each Thursday. The purpose of the meeting is to: 
			</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Share ideas about the project </li>
					<li>Track and monitor the progress of the work: and,  </li>
					<li>Agree on the project goals for the week ahead and allocate the work between ourselves. </li>
				</ul>
			<p>
				Following the team meeting, minutes will be issued to all team members to confirm the meeting's decisions and outline the agreed actions assigned through the meeting. <br>
				If a team member cannot attend a meeting, it is expected that they will provide 24 hours’ notice of their absence via email. As part of this email, the team member provides a status update of their work's progress and upload it to GitHub for the other team members to review.<br> 
				Where a team member fails to turn up two consecutive meetings without providing notice or providing an update, a follow-up email will be sent from the project manager. If no response is received within 48 hours of the email being sent, they will be removed from the team. 
			</p>
			<h3>Microsoft Teams</h3>
			<p>
				An ongoing chat has been established between the team members. The purpose of the discussion is to raise any issues or ask the other team members questions about their work.<br>
				This provides an open communication channel amongst team members to contact one another through the project's lifecycle. 
			</p>
			<h3>GitHub</h3>
			<p>
				Github will act as the central repository for the project, and its team members. It will be used throughout the project for the following purposes: 
			</p>
			<h4>Team Meetings</h4>
			<p>Store key artifacts from each project meeting. This includes: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>Meeting Agendas</li>
				<li>Minutes and Actions from meetings</li>
				<li>All recordings from the team meetings</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>Repository for Project Artefacts</h4>
			<p>Each team member will store their draft components of the assessment within Github. This will allow the other team members to review what they have drafted and easy access to update and provide feedback. <br>
			Posts to Github will be communicated via email and the team's chat to notify other team members of the updates. </p>

			<h2>Career Plans</h2>
			<p>
				<b>Career Plans</b><br>
				Andrew’s ideal job is to have a Service Design Lead/Human Centre Designer role in the future. <br> 
				James’ ideal job is to become a Game Developer. 
			</p>
			<h3>Similarities</h3>
			<p>Overall, there are no significant common elements between a Game Developer and that of a Service Design Lead based on the skills and experience outlined in both of the job advertisements. Both are fundamentally different in in their purpose and what they need to achieve. <br>
				There are three key elements that they do share in common. They are: <br>
				<b>Agile Delivery</b><br> 
				Agile is a set of principles and values shared amongst a team to form a framework to work together to deliver a solution of value to the customer.<br>
				<b>Problem Solving</b><br> 
				The ability to define a problem and constructively work to develop options to reduce or remove its impact. <br>
				<b>Web Development</b><br>
				The knowledge and skillset to design and stand-up a website to be used by an end customer.
			</p>
			<h3>Differences</h3>
			<p>The focus of a Service Design Lead is entirely different from that of a Gaming Developer. <br>
				As a Service Design Lead, the role is heavily research-focused. Working with customers and/or focus groups, you must gather key data points from them to define their problems and identify solutions to the products and services they use. <br>
				Applying the principles of design thinking, a Service Design Lead will take the customer through five process stages to develop a solution: </p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Empathy</b> - Understand the problem from a human context</li>
				<li><b>Define</b> - Research the problem</li>
				<li><b>Ideation</b> - Develop ideas that will resolve the problem</li>
				<li><b>Prototype</b> - Create basic solutions (wireframes, models) that can be tested quickly</li>
				<li><b>Test</b> - Tests the solution to ensure that it meets the customers’ needs or iterates it further based on their feedback. </li>
			</ul>
			<p>A Service Design Lead is not necessarily a technical role. Based on the research gathered, it documents the requirements that a solution architect and developer will use to develop a solution to solve a customer’s problem. <br>
				The role of a Gaming Developer is quite different in that they are responsible for developing a game's technical elements. They require component skills in several different development languages, architecture structures, and platforms to develop a concept from an idea into a full working gaming solution for general public use.<br>
				Based on our understanding and analysis of the ideal careers we wish to have in the IT industry, it is fair to say that the career paths and progression, and thus the plan, would be vastly different from each other.<br>
				To become a Service design Lead, Andrew would need to gain more hands-on experience in the application of the human centred design. Also, important would be the need to understand and have insight into different program languages like Java, HTML, etc, to support the development and testing of prototypes associated with future solution ideas. <br>
				To become a Game Developer, it would be best for James to undertake some study and training regarding game development, develop some small-scale games as a hobby and compete in indie game competitions to help build a network and open doors into the industry.</p>
