			<h1>Roles</h1>
				<p>As there are only two members within Team 31, it is recognised that we need to be quite flexible about the roles we play on the project. To ensure that there is coverage based on the position identified to deliver the project, the roles will generally be split as follows: </p>
				<ul>
					<li>Project Manager – Andrew Joyce </li>
					<li>UX Designer – James Cheuk </li>
					<li>Lead Developer – James Cheuk </li>
					<li>Tester – Andrew Joyce </li>
				</ul>
				<p>In section 4 of this report, the key responsibilities and skillset required for each of the roles are outlined to provide context to the work that needs to be undertaken. </p>
				<p>As part of the bi-weekly project meetings, the work that needs to be delivered over the next week will be defined and evenly divided. The meeting will also be used to track progress and remove any obstacles that are impeding progress. </p>

			<h1>Scope & Limits</h1>
				<h2>Scope</h2>
					<p>The project's scope will be restricted to developing a simple app for an Android or iOS device that will allow users to select a destination they would like an alarm to be triggered as they approach or arrive at it. </p>
					<p>The App will consist of 2 tiles a user will need to navigate through to set the alarm. The following capability will be available on each of the tiles: </p>
					<h3>Tile 1</h3>
						<p><b>Current Location</b></p>
						<p>Using the device's default map application automatically displays the current location based on GPS coordinates captured </p>
						<p><b>End Destination</b></p>
						<p>Allow users to search and select an address or location they would like an alarm triggered by their mobile device. </p>
					<h3>Tile 2</h3>
						<p><b>Select Distance from Destination Alarm</b></p>
						<p>Allow a user to select the distance from the destination the alarm is to be triggered. This distance may be between 1 kilometre to 50 metres from the end destination. </p>
						<p><b>Select Sound for Alarm</b></p>
						<p>Allows a user to select the alert's sound, which is triggered as they arrive at their destination. The selection of different sounds for the alarm will be restricted to five different sounds inbuilt into the App. </p>
						<p><b>Confirm your Alarm</b></p>
						<p>Allows the user to initiate the alert so that their mobile device can track their location via GPS to enable the alarm to be triggered once they approach or arrive at their destination. </p>
						<p><b>Distribution Channels</b></p>
						<p>Wake App will only be distributed through the Android Play Store or Apple’s App Store. </p>
				<h2>Limits</h2>
					<p>As part of the Wake App's initial release, only the App's necessary foundations will be developed. This includes excluding the following additional capabilities associated with the development of the App: </p>
					<ul>
						<li>Personalising the sound of the alert</li>
						<li>Enabling the user search and select different start location of the alarm </li>
						<li>Enabling the user to select travel mode to the destination such as a car, public transport, bike, and/or walking. </li>
					</ul>
