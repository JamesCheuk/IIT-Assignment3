			<h1>Testing</h1>
				<p>To test Wake App, we recommend that three phases of testing are undertaken to ensure that a workable solution can be delivered. The phases would consist of: </p>
				<h2>Usability Testing</h2>
					<p>Utilising a focus, we’d provide them with our wireframes to give feedback on the following aspects of our project: </p>
					<ul>
						<li>The user experience of our design </li>
						<li>Identify opportunities to improve the functionality of the App: and, </li>
						<li>Test the project idea to ensure that it meets the objectives of our project. </li>
					</ul>
					<p>Based on the group's feedback, we’d adapt our designs and requirements to ensure Wake App is easy to use and responds to the user’s needs. </p>
				<h2>System Testing</h2>
					<p>Post completion of the App's development and integrating all the components, system testing will be undertaken. </p>
					<p>The purpose of the is to ensure that Wake App meets all the purposed design's technical specifications. </p>
				<h2>User Acceptance Testing</h2>
					<p>User acceptance testing will be undertaken ideally after completing system testing and before the launch of Wake App to the general public.</p>
					<p>User acceptance testing aims to ensure that the App works as per the project's original objectives. The App will be tested with a small of users to ensure that it works as designed in practice.  Any identified defects would be addressed or placed in the product backlog to fix in a future release. </p>
