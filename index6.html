			<h1>Tools & Technologies</h1>
			<p>The tools and technologies we have identified that are needed for the project to be successful are:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Google Developer Account
					<p>This is necessary in order to be able to publish our applications on the Google Play Store, and has a one-time cost of $25 USD registration fee. No additional costs associated with free applications, but for paid applications Google takes 30% of the revenue for distribution partners and operating fees.</p>
				</li>
				<li>Google Play Console
					<p>This is the hub from which we manage everything associated with our project. This program allows us to manage the pre-launch development and access a wide range of tests to ensure the application is as bug-free as possible. It also allows us to manage the application after launch to manage its fees (if it’s a paid application), respond to user responses and more. Another important feature it has is it allows us to integrate maps into our application, which is a fundamental part of our project.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Material Design &#40;UI Creator&#41
							<p>Material is a Google creation, designed to help teams build high quality user interfaces from a large selection of components for various interfaces. </p>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Android Studio
					<p>This is Google’s official and recommended Integrated Developer Environment (IDE) for developing the code needed to run applications. It has support for multiple programming languages. It also has support for Android Package (APK) analysis to help reduce the file size, and a fast emulator to allow us to simulate running the application on different devices, configurations and features.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Languages
							<p>the official languages for Android Studio is Java and Kotlin, with additional support for C++, C#, LUA and JavaScript. </p>
						</li>
						<li>Software Development Kit &#40;SDK&#41
							<p>this is included in Android Studio and is required for creating applications for Android. It provides a selection of tools required to build Android applications and to allow run on Android devices and access unique features of the Android Operating System (OS).</p>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Google Maps Platform
					<p>This is a set of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and SDKs that allows developers to embed Google Maps into their mobile applications. Depending on how the map we embed on our application is used there is a cost associated which can be found here:<a href="https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/pricing/sheet/">Pricing Sheet</a></p>
				</li>
				<li>GitHub
					<p>This is a development platform which allows us to manage a project by creating a repository for it, which will include all the files the project will require including code files, images, any text files that are needed. It is a great place to ensure everything we need for our project is available. It can also create a website for us if we include the code files needed for it build the website. It is free of charge for the most basic purpose.</p>
					<p>Throughout the assessment, Microsoft Teams was used more from a collaboration perspective than GitHub. Teams was seen as better tool to communicate and share updates on the project over GitHub. </p>
				</li>
				<li>iMovie
					<p>Is a video editing tool that forms part of Apple’s standard operating system. It was used by the project team to develop and create the presentation submitted for assessment 5. </p>
